# Limitations - [Your Feature Name]

## Evidence-Driven Limitations

[Write 80-120 words describing specific limitations based on your test results. Be quantitative where possible.]

**Example (GOOD):**

This CLIP retrieval system fails on motion-blurred images with object motion >5 m/s (tested on 5 cases, 4 failed). Accuracy drops from 85% on clean images to 52% on low-light scenes (ISO >3200). Ambiguous queries like "animal" return mixed results (dogs, cats, birds) without disambiguation. The system cannot handle queries with typos and will return irrelevant results. Designed for well-lit, sharp photos with clear subjects. Not suitable for nighttime photography or action shots without additional training data.

## Requirements Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] 80-120 words (not more, not less)
- [ ] Specific failure scenarios from your test results
- [ ] Quantitative data where possible (percentages, thresholds, counts)
- [ ] No generic disclaimers like "may not work in all cases"
- [ ] Grounded in observed failures, not hypothetical edge cases

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Bad Example:**

"This system may not work in all cases. Performance may vary depending on input quality. Users should verify results. Not guaranteed to be 100% accurate."

**Why this is bad:**
- Generic disclaimers (not specific)
- No quantitative data
- Doesn't reference actual test failures
- Doesn't help users understand real limitations

✅ **Good Example:**

"This CLIP retrieval system fails on motion-blurred images with object motion >5 m/s (tested on 5 cases, 4 failed). Accuracy drops from 85% on clean images to 52% on low-light scenes (ISO >3200)..."

**Why this is good:**
- Specific failure scenarios
- Quantitative data (percentages, thresholds)
- References actual test results
- Helps users understand when NOT to use the system
